# TESLA UI CLONE.
## Overview
This project is Tesla website's UI clone and I tried to get as close as original tesla homepage and this is built to showcase front-end development skills. The website is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, (most of the part is build with html and css)replicating the key features and layout of Tesla's official site.
